# Mesothelioma Prediction with Machine Learning

This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at predicting mesothelioma, a rare but aggressive cancer primarily caused by asbestos exposure. The project leverages an artificial neural network (ANN) model to enhance diagnostic accuracy and facilitate early detection, ultimately aiming to save lives through more timely and precise diagnoses.

## Problem Statement

Mesothelioma can remain undiagnosed for up to 20 years due to the long latency period and lack of early symptoms. This cancer primarily affects the lining of the lungs and stomach, and construction workers, who are frequently exposed to asbestos, are at higher risk. Early detection is critical for improving treatment outcomes, but traditional diagnostic methods often fall short. This project investigates the potential of integrating machine learning into mesothelioma diagnosis to enable faster and more accurate predictions.

## Methodology

The proposed system uses an artificial neural network (ANN) implemented with the Keras library and optimized using the Adam algorithm. The process includes the following steps:

1. **Data Preparation**: Preprocessing and cleaning of data for use in training the model.
2. **Feature Selection**: Identifying the most relevant features to train the model.
3. **Data Partitioning**: Splitting data into training and test sets to evaluate model performance.
4. **Model Optimization**: Fine-tuning the ANN model using optimization techniques like Adam.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the performance of the model using appropriate metrics.
